## Local Deployment
Firstly, fork this repo and save it wherever you'd like. After pulling it to your IDE of choice, all you have to do is...
- Remove every instance of '/ProfessorFunk'. Since this project is deployed in Blade's GitHUb pages URL, the extra '/ProfessorFunk' was needed for online deployment. It is not needed for local deployment. This can easily be done in Visual Studio Code by using Ctrl + Shift + F and replacing all with nothing.
- You may deploy however you wish, but we installed the node http-server: npm i http-server -g
- If using the method above, deploy by typing 'http-server' into the terminal.
